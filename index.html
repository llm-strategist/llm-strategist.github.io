            We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) Agents in
            playing the strategic social deduction game, Resistance Avalon.
          </p>
          <p>  
            In this paper, we propose a new method <span class="textsc">Strategist</span> that utilizes LLMs to acquire new skills
            for playing multi-agent games through a self-improvement process. Our method gathers quality 
            feedback through self-play simulations with Monte Carlo tree search and LLM-based reflection, 
            which can then be used to learn high-level strategic skills such as how to evaluate states that 
            guide the low-level execution. We showcase how our method can be used in both action planning and 
            dialogue generation in the context of games, achieving good performance on both tasks.
          <p>
            Specifically, we demonstrate that our method can help train agents with better performance than both traditional 
            reinforcement learning-based approaches and other LLM-based skill learning approaches in the games 
            of Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and Resistance: Avalon.

              and improve previously learned strategies. We use low-level self-play simulations to guide the high-level search

          <p>
            Our improvement process contains two improvement steps in each improvement cycle --  
            the (1) reflection and idea generation step and (2) the strategy improvement step. 
            During the idea generation step we prompt the LLM to reflect on simulated self-play 
            feedback from previously evaluated strategies and generate possible improvement ideas 
            to the strategies and add them to the idea queue. During the strategy improvement step, 
            we select a strategy from the strategy tree and an improvement idea from the idea queue 
            and prompt the LLM to improve the strategy using the improvement idea. The improved 
            strategy is then evaluated via self-play simulations, and we use the feedback and reward 
            signals from the simulation to help guide future improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general goal in our decision-making setting is to learn a good policy function in 
            a sequential decision-making setting (generally formulated as a partially observable 
            Markov decision game (POMDG)), which can be done by improving strategies associated with 
            the policy function. We describe in more detail what a strategy looks like, how we derive 
            a policy function from a strategy, and how to acquire feedback for the strategy for both 
            dialogue generation and action generation here.

            During the <b>idea generation step</b>, a strategy and its simulated trajectory 
            feedback is first selected from the strategy tree according to the 
            adaptive selection policy. The feedback usually trajectories from previous self-play 
            simulations, including the states visited, actions taken at those states, the estimated 
            win-rate at that state, the final outcome of the trajectory, and any intermediate values 
            used during simulations at those states. Since these trajectories are very long (around 
            30 steps each for Avalon), we select some key states in the trajectory to translate into 
            natural language. We then prompt the LLM to reflect on this feedback and propose a couple 
            of new ideas on how to improve the function. These new ideas are added to the idea queue, 
            along with a score prior to how good the idea is. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During the <b>strategy improvement step</b>, we first select a strategy and an idea 
            from the libraries using the adaptive selection policy. We then prompt the LLM to implement 
            the idea of the strategy, generating a new improved strategy. We then evaluate the strategy 
            using the evaluator, which conducts self-play simulations with the strategy, and records the 
            simulated trajectory data. During simulations, players conduct an MCTS tree search to estimate 
            the expected win-rate at different states, which provides additional feedback. We add the 
            improved strategy (and its performance) to the strategy tree, and update the improvement 
            score for the idea that was used.

            In conclusion, we have presented <span>Strategist</span>, a generalizable non-parametric self-improvement 
            framework that learns and improves skills. Given the rules of the game, our method is able to 
            learn good strategies to play the game through self-play without task-specific prompting 
              or human generated policy data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The performance of <span>Strategist</span> suggests that incorporating better guidance, 
            whether this be through modular high-level search or low-level simulated self-play feedback, 
            into LLM-improvement processes can greatly enhance the improvement process.

        <strong>Value heuristic system prompt</strong>
        <p>You are a function engineer trying to write a function that can evaluate the value of a state in a game. 
          This is known as a value heuristic, and will be used in look-ahead search algorithms to evaluate the value 
          of unexplored states. Your goal is to develop a heuristic that is as accurate as possible without being 
          too expensive to compute. Hence, you are not allowed to runs simulations in the function.</p>
        <p></p>
        <strong>Value heuristics function signature</strong>
        <p>The function (written in python) should be named `evaluate state' and take in a tuple called `state' of the game state as input. 
          Specifically, the input tuple will be of length 9, and it should return 2 elements. 
          The first element should be a tuple with 2 floats: the first element being the score you expect player 0 will get at the end of the game, and the second element being the score you expect player 1 will get at the end of the game.
          The second element should be a dictionary of any important intermediate values that you used to calculate the scores.
          For example, if you think player 0 will win 12 total points by the end of the game and player 1 will win 8 total points, the function should return (12, 8).
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Make sure your output only includes the code of the function itself in plain text such that it is executable using exec() in python. Any helper functions should be defined within the scope of the function `evaluate state'.
          Include comments in your code so that it is readable, but everything should be implemented.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The signature of the function should be as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
def evaluate_state(state) -> tuple[tuple[float, float], dict]:
    score_cards = state[0] # a python list of the score cards (integers) that have been played, in the order they were played
    player_0_played_cards = state[1] # a python list of the cards (integers) player 0 has played, in the order they were played. 
    player_1_played_cards = state[2] # a python list of the cards (integers) player 1 has played, in the order they were played. 
    is_turn = state[3] # bool, true if it is you and your opponent's turn to play, false if it is time to draw a new score card
    player_0_score = state[4] # float or integer, player 0's score so far
    player_1_score = state[5] #  float or integer, player 1's score so far
    score_deck = state[6] # a python set of the score cards (integers) left in the deck, either same length as player_0_hand and player_1_hand or one less since the score card appears before the players play. May be empty
    player_0_hand = state[7] # a python set of the cards (integers) left in player 0's hand. May be empty
    player_1_hand = state[8] # a python set of the cards (integers) left in player 1's hand. May be empty
    # explanation of what we do next
    ...
    <intermediate_value1> = value1 
    # explanation of what we do next
    ...
    <intermediate_value2> = value2 
    # explanation of what we do next
    ...
    player_scores = (player_0_expected_score, player_1_expected_score)
    intermediate_values = {'<intermediate_value1>': intermediate_value1, '<intermediate_value2>': intermediate_value2, ...}
    return player_scores, intermediate_values # make sure the return is exactly in this format
        </code></pre>
        <p>Where you can use your own names for the intermediate values and the values themselves.
          Please start with "def evaluate state(state):"</p>

        <strong>Dialogue guide system prompt</strong>
        <p>You are a coach trying to write a section of a strategy guide on how to play a game well.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The specific section of the strategy guide you are writing right now is on how to play the Merlin 
          role effectively during the discussion phase so that they can win the game. Recall that players often 
          use the discussion phase to (1) gather information about other players, (2) try to convince other players 
          of their innocence or guilt, and (3) try to persuade other players of a particular course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game you are interested in is called The Resistance: Avalon. The Resistance: Avalon is the game of 
          hidden identities and social deduction. There are two teams in the game: Good and Evil. Each player has 
          a hidden identity (role) and side.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <strong>Dialogue guide signature</strong>
        <p>Your guide should be in the form of a worksheet that the student can use to build their speech. You should order the worksheet questions in a way that makes logical sense, and you should have no more than six questions. Your questions should instruct the reader to write parts of their speech.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The title of your section should be ``Questions to fill out before speaking as the Merlin role''. Below is an example of how your worksheet should look like:</p>

        <p><strong>Avalon Value Heuristics Function Improvement Idea</strong></p>
        <p>Incorporate a more nuanced success probability calculation based on the roles of the players 
          and the current phase of the game. For example, in phase 1 (team selection), consider the balance 
          of Good and Evil players on the quest team and adjust the success probability accordingly. 
          This can help better reflect the strategic considerations during team selection.
